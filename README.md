# PostureFy! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
How often have you found sitting on your chair for hours, hunching forward to get that 5cm closer to your computer screen? 
How is your back doing? Mine suffers a lot.
That's why I wanted to build PostureFy, an app that helps reduce back problems caused by long sitting hours
## What does PostureFy do?
- PostureFy uses machine learning to monitor your body posture, track how long you spend sitting with bad posture and notify you if you have spent too long sitting that way. 
- It also will guide you through stretching routines by monitoring your posture(using ML) and guiding you into the correct position for the stretch.
- You can also set up reminders for yourself for taking breaks in between long sitting hours, and PostureFy will send you desktop notifications.
## Technologies used
- React, Material-UI, Teachable Machine (TensorFlow.js)

Still currently working on this app, such as improving the AI stretching instructor feature, polishing UI and cleaning up code
